---> today i have practice more on push,commit,add, in my batman repository
---> and learn how to copy file from one branch to another branch we can do using followig
	1) add file in one branch1
	2) commit and push the file in 
	3) now switch on another branch2
	4) then pull the all file from branch1 using "git pull origin branch1"
	5) now you can add this file in branch2 using git add,commit, push

---> then i do the same in my cybercom-creation repository

---> the simply go on google and try varios command of git, like how to show branches using "git branch" command that show the status now on which currently login 

---> read the document provided by sir and learn how ti set the defult code editor for git bash

---> then at the last practice in main repository thet command given by sir 
	create branch1 and add index file and change the file text and commit and push it 
	after that go in to main branch then merge the file from branch1
	after that again go in branch1 then merge the main branch 
---> this will point the same commit of main branch

---> undestand the merge-commit to revert the all commit.
