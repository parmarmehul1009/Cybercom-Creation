---> today i have first the read the questions in document then i try to solve it 
	
	1) how to merge two branch in one branch
		- first make a branch3 from the one of branch that you have to merge like branch1 "git checkout -b branch3 origin/branch1"
		- then push in branch3 "git push origin branch3"
		- then use merge command to copy content of branch2 "git merge --no-ff origin/branch2"
		- then push again in branch3 "git push origin branch3"
		- it's show that content off branch1 and branch2 are merged in to branch3

	2) how to copy only one file from one branch to another branch
		- first go in to that branch in which you want to copy file from otherbranch
		- then write command like "git checkout otherbranch myfile.txt"
		- it's copy file from branch
		- then add,commit and push it in to your branch

---> then i have search another command like

	1) how to remove file from repository as well as from filesyatem, use:
		- "git rm index.php"
	But if you want to remove the file only from the Git repository and not remove it from the filesystem, use:
		- "git rm --cached file1.txt"
	
	2) how to update and add new content in file
		- "cat update.txt" --> it show the content that is already present in file
		- "echo 'write line to add in update file at the end of the file' >> update.txt"
		- the add, commit and push file
---> then rest of the day practice on yesterday code .
