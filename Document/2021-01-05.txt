today i have learnt how generate SSH key for my computer.
and i practice all git command like git push, git commit, during commit in my main branch another window of git bash is open and in this window thay ask please write commant why this commit is necessary.

so i have search for this why this is comming and i got one solution from stackoverflow url = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19085807/please-enter-a-commit-message-to-explain-why-this-merge-is-necessary-especially"

solution step for this window is:press 
					1. "i" (i for insert)
					2. write your merge message
					3. press "esc" (escape)
					4. write ":wq" (write & quit)
					5. then press enter

and then i show that this message i write in this window is visible in github.

and complete all commands and practice 2 time and understand it
